   abstract = {The Astropy project supports and fosters the development of open-source and
openly-developed Python packages that provide commonly-needed functionality to
the astronomical community. A key element of the Astropy project is the core
package Astropy, which serves as the foundation for more specialized projects
and packages. In this article, we provide an overview of the organization of
the Astropy project and summarize key features in the core package as of the
recent major release, version 2.0. We then describe the project infrastructure
designed to facilitate and support development for a broader ecosystem of
inter-operable packages. We conclude with a future outlook of planned new
features and directions for the broader Astropy project.},

@article{Natarajan2021,
   abstract = {We present Quasarnet, a novel research platform that enables deployment of
data-driven modeling techniques for the investigation of the properties of
super-massive black holes. Black hole data sets -- observations and simulations
-- have grown rapidly in the last decade in both complexity and abundance.
However, our computational environments and tool sets have not matured
commensurately to exhaust opportunities for discovery with these data. Our
pilot study presented here is motivated by one of the fundamental open
questions in understanding black hole formation and assembly across cosmic time
- the nature of the black hole host galaxy and parent dark matter halo
connection. To explore this, we combine and co-locate large, observational data
sets of quasars, the high-redshift luminous population of accreting black
holes, at z > 3 alongside simulated data spanning the same cosmic epochs in
Quasarnet. We demonstrate the extraction of the properties of observed quasars
and their putative dark matter parent halos that permit studying their
association and correspondence. In this paper, we describe the design,
implementation, and operation of the publicly queryable Quasarnet database and
provide examples of query types and visualizations that can be used to explore
the data. Starting with data collated in Quasarnet, which will serve as
training sets, we plan to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict
properties of the as yet undetected, less luminous quasar population. To that
ultimate goal, here we present the first key step in building the
BH-galaxy-halo connection that underpins the formation and evolution of
supermassive black holes. All our codes and compiled data are available on the
public Google Kaggle Platform.},

@article{Kendall2017,
   abstract = {There are two major types of uncertainty one can model. Aleatoric uncertainty
captures noise inherent in the observations. On the other hand, epistemic
uncertainty accounts for uncertainty in the model -- uncertainty which can be
explained away given enough data. Traditionally it has been difficult to model
epistemic uncertainty in computer vision, but with new Bayesian deep learning
tools this is now possible. We study the benefits of modeling epistemic vs.
aleatoric uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning models for vision tasks. For
this we present a Bayesian deep learning framework combining input-dependent
aleatoric uncertainty together with epistemic uncertainty. We study models
under the framework with per-pixel semantic segmentation and depth regression
tasks. Further, our explicit uncertainty formulation leads to new loss
functions for these tasks, which can be interpreted as learned attenuation.
This makes the loss more robust to noisy data, also giving new state-of-the-art
results on segmentation and depth regression benchmarks.},

   abstract = {In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on
its accuracy in the large-scale image recognition setting. Our main
contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an
architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a
significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by
pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our
ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the
second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We
also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where
they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing
ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of
deep visual representations in computer vision.},

   abstract = {The paper presents the third data release of Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), a wide-field multi-band imaging survey with the
Subaru 8.2m telescope. HSC-SSP has three survey layers (Wide, Deep, and
UltraDeep) with different area coverages and depths, designed to address a wide
array of astrophysical questions. This third release from HSC-SSP includes data
from 278 nights of observing time and covers about 670 square degrees in all
five broad-band filters at the full depth ($\sim26$~mag at $5\sigma$) in the
Wide layer. If we include partially observed area, the release covers 1,470
square degrees. The Deep and UltraDeep layers have $\sim80\%$ of the originally
planned integration times, and are considered done, as we have slightly changed
the observing strategy in order to compensate for various time losses. There
are a number of updates in the image processing pipeline. Of particular
importance is the change in the sky subtraction algorithm; we subtract the sky
on small scales before the detection and measurement stages, which has
significantly reduced false detections. Thanks to this and other updates, the
overall quality of the processed data has improved since the previous release.
However, there are limitations in the data (for example, the pipeline is not
optimized for crowded fields), and we encourage the user to check the quality
assurance plots as well as a list of known issues before exploiting the data.

   abstract = {The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization
instead of optimization, not the prior, or Bayes rule. Bayesian inference is
especially compelling for deep neural networks. (1) Neural networks are
typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many different but high
performing models corresponding to different settings of parameters, which is
exactly when marginalization will make the biggest difference for both
calibration and accuracy. (2) Deep ensembles have been mistaken as competing
approaches to Bayesian methods, but can be seen as approximate Bayesian
marginalization. (3) The structure of neural networks gives rise to a
structured prior in function space, which reflects the inductive biases of
neural networks that help them generalize. (4) The observed correlation between
parameters in flat regions of the loss and a diversity of solutions that
provide good generalization is further conducive to Bayesian marginalization,
as flat regions occupy a large volume in a high dimensional space, and each
different solution will make a good contribution to a Bayesian model average.
(5) Recent practical advances for Bayesian deep learning provide improvements
in accuracy and calibration compared to standard training, while retaining
scalability.},

@article{Natarajan2021,
   abstract = {We present Quasarnet, a novel research platform that enables deployment of
data-driven modeling techniques for the investigation of the properties of
super-massive black holes. Black hole data sets -- observations and simulations
-- have grown rapidly in the last decade in both complexity and abundance.
However, our computational environments and tool sets have not matured
commensurately to exhaust opportunities for discovery with these data. Our
pilot study presented here is motivated by one of the fundamental open
questions in understanding black hole formation and assembly across cosmic time
- the nature of the black hole host galaxy and parent dark matter halo
connection. To explore this, we combine and co-locate large, observational data
sets of quasars, the high-redshift luminous population of accreting black
holes, at z > 3 alongside simulated data spanning the same cosmic epochs in
Quasarnet. We demonstrate the extraction of the properties of observed quasars
and their putative dark matter parent halos that permit studying their
association and correspondence. In this paper, we describe the design,
implementation, and operation of the publicly queryable Quasarnet database and
provide examples of query types and visualizations that can be used to explore
the data. Starting with data collated in Quasarnet, which will serve as
training sets, we plan to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict
properties of the as yet undetected, less luminous quasar population. To that
ultimate goal, here we present the first key step in building the
BH-galaxy-halo connection that underpins the formation and evolution of
supermassive black holes. All our codes and compiled data are available on the
public Google Kaggle Platform.},
